        \n\n<b>History</b>
        \n\nSince 1947, a university in this region has been a long cherished dream. 
        A popular demand for a kind of university which can reach out to a 
        large number of students desiring higher education in this vast region 
        has always been intensely felt but has never been fulfilled. In 2001, 
        the then Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina laid the foundations of Rangpur 
        University of Science and Technology. However, later on the establishment 
        was cancelled. It was not until August 2007 when Fakhruddin Ahmed, 
        Chief Advisor of the Caretaker Government, agreed in principle to 
        establish a full fledged university in Rangpur.Finally, 
        Dr. Fakhruddin Ahmad, in a historic cabinet meeting held in 
        Rangpur on February 2, 2008, took the decision to establish a 
        University in Rangpur. The Rangpur University Ordinance was 
        approved by the cabinet on June 15, 2008. M. Lutfar Rahman 
        was appointed the first Vice Chancellor on 20 October 2008. 
        Two days later Hossain Zillur Rahman, the then Education and 
        Commerce Advisor to the Caretaker Government formally inaugurated the university.
